Evolutionary Algorithm

The main branch shows one part of the evolutionary process. To see the most up to date information for different hyperparameters go do different branches as described below: 

age-configurations: exploring the effect on max age of an individual

combination-configuruations: verifying assumption that pattern matching is bettern than ranom 2 point crossover

parent-configurations: exploring the effect on crossing different numbers of random parents to one child

predator-configurations: seeing the impact of these hyperparameters when the predator changes twice at predetermined intervals of the generations.
